                <div class="aboutme">
                    <p> A 22 year old graphic designer and web enthusiast from Washington (the state). I specialize in the design & development of the web. However, I also enjoy creating work that doesn't belong on the internet. I try to find inspiration in anything and everything in order to craft unique and creative design every time.</p> 
                    <p> I’d like to say I have hobbies, but I’m a student (almost a graduate), so we all know that wouldn’t be the truth. However, when I do have free time, I’m usually immersed in design books while snuggling with my two dogs. </p>

                    <h2>I AM...</h2>
                    <h3>A Creative Problem Solver,</h3>
                    <p>When I'm faced with a creative problem, I will do whatever it takes to solve it. Pulling inspiration from this giant world around me, I can figure out new solutions to old problems. Just as finding a solution is important, I believe it is important to display the solution in a fresh and creative way.   </p>
                </div>
                <div class="details">
                    <h3>Detail Oriented,</h3>
                    <p>I believe in taking special care of the details and paying special attention to each and every pixel in all my work. When all aspects of a piece are taken care of, clients and users feel like the work was created for them. I don't simply make things pretty, I handcraft experiences.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="details">
                    <h3>& Passionate!</h3>
                    <p>As a designer, I feel that passion outweighs skill. When you passion for something, the quality will reflect. I'm passionate in my work because I want every client to feel important and every project to be unique enough to stand alone.  </p>
